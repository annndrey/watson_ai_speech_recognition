Speaker 0: so  thank you very much for coming David's good to have you here
Speaker 1: good  is my pleasure Michael glad to be with you
Speaker 0: how  real is artificial intelligence
Speaker 1: the  question of how real is artificial intelligence is a complex one on I would say %HESITATION if if we define artificial intelligence is the ability of a machine on its own to understand large volumes of data to reason that data with a purpose to it to predict the future and then tell you continue to learn and get better that is happening today in certain fields
Speaker 0: how  far in the continuum is IBM Watson in operability artificial intelligence
Speaker 1: yes  so the first of all once once it's actually intelligent it will no longer be artificial so we're moving to the point that these systems increasingly understand enormous volumes of dataso thank you very much for coming David's good to have you here good is my pleasure Michael glad to be with you
